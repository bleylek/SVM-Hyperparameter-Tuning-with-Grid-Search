SVM Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search

Project Overview:
This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook dedicated to optimizing Support Vector Machine (SVM) hyperparameters through grid search. The project focuses on enhancing the performance of SVMs in classification tasks by systematically exploring various combinations of hyperparameters to find the most effective settings.

Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
Scikit-learn: Employed for implementing SVM and conducting the grid search.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.


Features

Detailed implementation of grid search to optimize SVM parameters.
Evaluation metrics to assess model performance, including precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualizations to illustrate model performance and data characteristics.
